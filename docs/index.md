## Acknowledgements

This document has been prepared by the Association of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists (AGS) with the encouragement and support of the working party members. The AGS acknowledges the generous time and resources given to the project by the individual members and their employers. Without their enthusiastic support this ongoing project would not be possible.

Comment and feedback from the wider geotechnical and geoenvironmental industry has also been fundamental to the ongoing evolution of the AGS Format, ensuring that the needs of the industry and its clients continue to be met.

## Foreword

The AGS Data Management Working Party continually monitors the use of the AGS Format within the industry and strives to ensure its relevance to current working practice.

In response to new laboratory industry standards and updated UK practice the AGS4.0.4 Version (February 2017) document has been updated and amended and shall be known as &quot;AGS 4.1&quot;. Version 4.1 represents a substantial update of the Data Dictionary, introducing 24 new Groups, some of which replace Groups such as ERES, IPRG and IPRT. Detailed changes are listed in Section 6.3.

The Rules have not changed since version 4.0.4, but they have been moved into a new section (4.1.1) and tabulated for clarity. Moving the rules into a discrete section will allow the format and this document to be developed using other AGS approved file formats to maximise the potential for web-enabled transfer of data. Note that any new file formats shall be compliant with the Data Dictionary.

Whilst the AGS Format is used throughout the world, this document is specifically written for use in accordance with UK practice. Please contact the AGS secretariat for advice on adoption of the AGS Format internationally.

The use of BS 8574:2014 should be used to support the consistent and transparent use of the AGS Format in ground engineering projects.
