Foreword The AGS Data Management Working Party continually monitors the use of the AGS Format within the industry and strives to ensure its relevance to current working practice. In response to new laboratory industry standards and updated UK practice the AGS4.0.4 Version (February 2017) document has been updated and amended and shall be known as \"AGS 4.1\". Version 4.1 represents a substantial update of the Data Dictionary, introducing 24 new Groups, some of which replace Groups such as ERES, IPRG and IPRT. Detailed changes are listed in Section 6.3. The Rules have not changed since version 4.0.4, but they have been moved into a new section (4.1.1) and tabulated for clarity. Moving the rules into a discrete section will allow the format and this document to be developed using other AGS approved file formats to maximise the potential for web-enabled transfer of data. Note that any new file formats shall be compliant with the Data Dictionary. Whilst the AGS Format is used throughout the world, this document is specifically written for use in accordance with UK practice. Please contact the AGS secretariat for advice on adoption of the AGS Format internationally. The use of BS 8574:2014 should be used to support the consistent and transparent use of the AGS Format in ground engineering projects.

Prior to this there was a proliferation of software systems and associated data formats that differed both in form and purpose even though much of their content was common. This was recognised by the Association of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists (AGS) in 1991 and led to the setting up of a Working Party to establish an interchange format which allowed transfer of data between systems with minimal change to the systems themselves. The outcome of this work was embodied in the First Edition of this document published in 1992. The Second and Third Editions, published in 1994 and 1999 respectively, contained a series of updates and developments reflecting the ongoing needs of the industry. The producers of geotechnical and geoenvironmental data have adopted systems for the efficient preparation and presentation of reports in printed format and the receivers for its analysis. Clearly, the transfer of data by electronic means to the receiver's systems, without the need for a printed interface, helps to minimise costs, time and the potential for error. It also encourages more and better use of the data. However, much remains to be done to encourage the use of data in the electronic format and the ongoing development of the AGS Format seeks to encourage its use not only in ground investigation but also in the design, bidding and construction phases of projects. The capability of a geotechnical and geoenvironmental data system to accept or produce AGS Format data allows the data system operator to continue to use their own individual and bespoke processes and working methods, such as familiar data capture or processing forms, without compromising the ability to exchange data with clients, partners or suppliers. This aids the implementation and continual improvement of quality assurance procedures within data producers and receivers. Storage and access to the data is rendered far more efficient and the format also facilitates the establishment of data archives by producers, receivers and national bodies. This document describes an update of the AGS Format and continues the trend of updating the Format in response to industry requirements.

The data dictionary is maintained by the AGS Data Management Working Group. The data items are those which are required to be reported by the standards and specifications used for carrying out the work; for example BS 5930, BS 1377, BS EN ISO 17892 etc. The data dictionary organises these items into Groups, each Group is for a specific part of the investigation such as the location of an investigation point, the description of excavation of the borehole, a laboratory test or an in situ test. Each Group contains a list of data Headings which contain the individual data variables and data items (such as data types, units and descriptions). For a specific project it may be practical to extract a limited set of Groups if many of the other Groups are not needed. Additions to the data dictionary for the project must be clearly included in the specification and agreed between data providers and receivers at the outset of the project. Data Format Schema (Group Hierarchy) AGS4 Groups are organised in a hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy is the PROJ Group, with the majority of other Groups below this. One of the Groups immediately below PROJ is Location Details (LOCA). All of the in situ testing data lies directly below LOCA; for example SPT results in the ISPT Group. LOCA is termed the 'parent' Group of ISPT and ISPT is termed a 'child' Group of LOCA. The parent group of all the laboratory testing is sample data (SAMP). A Group has only one parent defined in the Hierarchy, but there can be many child Groups below each parent. Each child Group is linked to its parent Group by the Key Fields. The table in section 3.6 defines the Group hierarchy by indicating the parent for each Group. The Key Fields that create the link between these Groups are indicated in the Data Dictionary. There are ten Groups that are not part of this hierarchy and relate to the data file submission and description. The PROJ, TRAN, ABBR, TYPE, DICT, FILE, UNIT, LBSG, PREM and STND Groups each have a general purpose to describe the content of the data file as follows: The PROJ, TRAN, ABBR, TYPE and UNIT Groups shall always be included in an AGS file as they define the project, the submission details and the abbreviations, data types and units used within the data file (see rules 13,14,15,16,17). The DICT Group shall be included if any user defined Groups or Headings are present. (Rule 18) The STND Group should be used to list the various standards and specifications that define the methods by which the data has been collected. The LBSG Group should be used to transfer laboratory test scheduling. The PREM Group should be used to give time-related remarks that refer to the project as a whole and not to any specific location or test. The FILE Group should be used if any associated files (non-AGS Format files) are included in the submission (Rule 20). Heading Status Each Heading has a defined status as listed below: Status Indicator Description Example / Notes * KEY All KEY Headings shall be included in the group. The combination of data recorded within the KEY Headings of each group shall be unique. Rule 10a refers. R REQUIRED Data under these headings shall not be null. Rule 10b & Rule 12 refers.The AGS Edition Reference shall be included under the TRAN_AGS Heading to associate the file to the document that contains the specification of Headings. OTHERThe presence of these Headings and data under these Headings are dictated by the scope of the project specification. Data Types The TYPE and UNIT selected for a heading are inter-linked. The data types for each heading are provided in the Data Dictionary. The types in the data dictionary should be used unless otherwise agreed between data provider and receiver in accordance with a project specification. Type Description Example / Notes ID Unique Identifier An ID is a unique identifier used across the project.The ID shall be unique in the parent group but may be repeated in child groups i.e. SAMP (parent) vs ELRG (child), LOCA (parent) vs SAMP (child). PA Text listed in ABBR Group Abbreviations listed in ABBR group. Rule 16 refers.The list of standard abbreviations and descriptions are presented on the AGS website and shall not be redefined. Other abbreviations may be defined as required within a project, but shall not match/impersonate existing standard abbreviations e.g. \"CP\" for 'Cable percussion' in LOCA_TYPE shall not be given a non-standard abbreviation defined as \"CH\" for 'Cable hole'; likewise \"SCP\" (Static cone penetrometer) shall not be replaced by a non-standard abbreviation of \"CPT\" (Cone penetration test). Multiple abbreviations can be used in a data VARIABLE. Where this occurs, abbreviations are joined using the concatenation character defined in TRAN_RCON (a \"+\" character by default). PT Text listed in TYPE Group Abbreviations listed in TYPE group. Rule 17 refers. PU Text listed in UNIT Group Abbreviations listed in UNIT group. Rule 15 refers.The list of standard units and descriptions are presented on the AGS website and shall not be redefined.This list is case sensitive. X Text Abbreviations used in text data shall be listed in the ABBR group. Rule 16 refers. XN Text / numeric There are some measured parameters that are typically numeric but can have a valid result that is text; examples include plastic limit (34 or NP) and depth of water in a borehole (2.34 or dry).Abbreviations used in text data shall be listed in the ABBR group. Rule 16 refers. T Elapsed Time e.g. hh:mm:ss DT Date time in international format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ(+hh:mm) or yyyy-mm-dd or hh:mm:ss or yyyy This format may be used in full or part based on user requirements MC British Standard BS1377 : Part 2 reported moisture content This data type is included for legacy reasons and not used in AGS 4.1 _n_DP Value with required number of decimal places e.g. 2DP = 2 decimal places = 2.34 _n_SF Value with required number of significant figures e.g. 2SF = 2 significant figures = 1.2, 10 _n_SCI Scientific Notation with required number of decimal places e.g. 73100 as 2SCI = 7.31E4; 73100 as 1SCI = 7.3E4 U Value with a variable format This is used for fields that contain values with differing accuracy; e.g. AGS 4.1 = ELRG_RVAL (AGS 4.0 = ERES_RVAL).

Units of Measurement The units for each heading are provided in the Data Dictionary. The units should be in accordance with the specifications and standards used in the UK. The units in the data dictionary should be used unless otherwise agreed between data provider and receiver in accordance with a project specification. Heading Examples Typical examples are given against most of the data Headings to indicate the type of information that might be expected.

The data dictionary is maintained by the AGS Data Management Working Group. The data items are those which are required to be reported by the standards and specifications used for carrying out the work; for example BS 5930, BS 1377, BS EN ISO 17892 etc. The data dictionary organises these items into Groups, each Group is for a specific part of the investigation such as the location of an investigation point, the description of excavation of the borehole, a laboratory test or an in situ test. Each Group contains a list of data Headings which contain the individual data variables and data items (such as data types, units and descriptions). For a specific project it may be practical to extract a limited set of Groups if many of the other Groups are not needed. Additions to the data dictionary for the project must be clearly included in the specification and agreed between data providers and receivers at the outset of the project.","title":"Data Dictionary"},{"location":"Data%20Dictionary/#data-format-schema-group-hierarchy","text":"AGS4 Groups are organised in a hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy is the PROJ Group, with the majority of other Groups below this. One of the Groups immediately below PROJ is Location Details (LOCA). All of the in situ testing data lies directly below LOCA; for example SPT results in the ISPT Group. LOCA is termed the 'parent' Group of ISPT and ISPT is termed a 'child' Group of LOCA. The parent group of all the laboratory testing is sample data (SAMP). A Group has only one parent defined in the Hierarchy, but there can be many child Groups below each parent. Each child Group is linked to its parent Group by the Key Fields. The table in section 3.6 defines the Group hierarchy by indicating the parent for each Group. The Key Fields that create the link between these Groups are indicated in the Data Dictionary. There are ten Groups that are not part of this hierarchy and relate to the data file submission and description. The PROJ, TRAN, ABBR, TYPE, DICT, FILE, UNIT, LBSG, PREM and STND Groups each have a general purpose to describe the content of the data file as follows: The PROJ, TRAN, ABBR, TYPE and UNIT Groups shall always be included in an AGS file as they define the project, the submission details and the abbreviations, data types and units used within the data file (see rules 13,14,15,16,17). The DICT Group shall be included if any user defined Groups or Headings are present. (Rule 18) The STND Group should be used to list the various standards and specifications that define the methods by which the data has been collected. The LBSG Group should be used to transfer laboratory test scheduling. The PREM Group should be used to give time-related remarks that refer to the project as a whole and not to any specific location or test. The FILE Group should be used if any associated files (non-AGS Format files) are included in the submission (Rule 20).","title":"Data Format Schema (Group Hierarchy)"},{"location":"Data%20Dictionary/#heading-status","text":"Each Heading has a defined status as listed below: Status Indicator Description Example / Notes * KEY All KEY Headings shall be included in the group.
